# Human-in-the-Loop Workflow for Systematic Creation of Content for Scientific Knowledge Graphs
The primary goal of this workflow is to improve the systematic review process by introducing a human-in-the-loop workflow to mainly:

* Assist researchers in identifying and curating a relevant corpus of literature.
* Extract key information from scientific papers using LLMs.
* Facilitate data import into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).

  This workflow is composed of 2 main stages:

* Stage 1: Creating a scientific corpus of literature.
* Stage 2: Knowledge extraction and validation.

When starting , make sure to press the Fast Forward ▶️ button to start the compilation process. This step is essential to trigger the execution of the workflow and ensure that all scripts and configurations are properly processed.
